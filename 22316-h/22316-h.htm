    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the very day when Charles I. was crowned with due rejoicings&mdash;Candlemasday,
      in the year of our Lord 1626&mdash;a loyalty, quite as deep and perhaps
      even more lasting, was having its beer at Ley Manor in the north of Devon.
      A loyalty not to the king, for the old West-country folk knew little and
      cared less about the house that came over the Border; but to a lord who
      had won their hearts by dwelling among them, and dealing kindly, and
      paying his way every Saturday night. When this has been done for three
      generations general and genial respect may almost be relied upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present Baron de Wichehalse was fourth in descent from that Hugh de
      Wichehalse, the head of an old and wealthy race, who had sacrificed his
      comfort to his resolve to have a will of his own in matters of religion.
      That Hugh de Wichehalse, having an eye to this, as well as the other
      world, contrived to sell his large estates before they were confiscated,
      and to escape with all the money, from very sharp measures then enforced,
      by order of King Philip II., in the unhappy Low Countries. Landing in
      England, with all his effects and a score of trusty followers, he bought a
      fine property, settled, and died, and left a good name behind him. And
      that good name had been well kept up, and the property had increased and
      thriven, so that the present lord was loved and admired by all the
      neighbourhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one thing, however, he had been unlucky, at least in his own opinion.
      Ten years of married life had not found issue in parental life. All his
      beautiful rocks and hills, lovely streams and glorious woods, green
      meadows and golden corn lands, must pass to his nephew and not to his
      child, because he had not gained one. Being a good man, he did his best to
      see this thing in its proper light. Children, after all, are a plague, a
      risk, and a deep anxiety. His nephew was a very worthy boy, and his rights
      should be respected. Nevertheless, the baron often longed to supersede
      them. Of this there was every prospect now. The lady of the house had
      intrusted her case to a highly celebrated simple-woman, who lived among
      rocks and scanty vegetation at Heddon's Mouth, gathering wisdom from the
      earth and from the sea tranquillity. De Wichehalse was naturally vexed a
      little when all this accumulated wisdom culminated in nothing grander than
      a somewhat undersized, and unhappily female child&mdash;one, moreover,
      whose presence cost him that of his faithful and loving wife. So that the
      heiress of Ley Manor was greeted, after all, with a very brief and sorry
      welcome. &ldquo;Jennyfried,&rdquo; for so they named her, soon began to grow into a
      fair esteem and good liking. Her father, after a year or two, plucked up
      his courage and played with her; and the more he played the more pleased
      he was, both with her and his own kind self. Unhappily, there were at that
      time no shops in the neighbourhood; unhappily, now there are too many.
      Nevertheless, upon the whole, she had all the toys that were good for her;
      and her teeth had a fair chance of fitting themselves for life's chief
      operation in the absence of sugared allurements.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief and meagre account is this of the birth, and growth, and condition
      of a maiden whose beauty and goodness still linger in the winter tales of
      many a simple homestead. For, sharing her father's genial nature, she went
      about among the people in her soft and playful way; knowing all their
      cares, and gifted with a kindly wonder at them, which is very soothing.
      All the simple folk expected condescension from her; and she would have
      let them have it, if she had possessed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she was come to a time of life when maidens really must begin to
      consider their responsibilities&mdash;a time when it does matter how the
      dress sits and what it is made of, and whether the hair is well arranged
      for dancing in the sunshine and for fluttering in the moonlight; also that
      the eyes convey not from that roguish nook the heart any betrayal of &ldquo;hide
      and seek&rdquo;; neither must the risk of blushing tremble on perpetual brinks;
      neither must&mdash;but, in a word, 'twas the seventeenth year of a
      maiden's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      More and more such matters gained on her motherless necessity. Strictly
      anxious as she was to do the right thing always, she felt more and more
      upon every occasion (unless it was something particular) that her cousin
      need not so impress his cousinly salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert de Wichehalse (who received that name before it became so
      inevitable) was that same worthy boy grown up as to whom the baron had
      felt compunctions, highly honourable to either party, touching his
      defeasance; or rather, perhaps, as to interception of his presumptive
      heirship by the said Albert, or at least by his mother contemplated. And
      Albert's father had entrusted him to his uncle's special care and love,
      having comfortably made up his mind, before he left this evil world, that
      his son should have a good slice of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, therefore, the baron's chief desire was to heal all breaches and make
      things pleasant, and to keep all the family property snug by marrying his
      fair Jennyfried (or &ldquo;Frida,&rdquo; as she was called at home) to her cousin
      Albert, now a fine young fellow of five-and-twenty. De Wichehalse was
      strongly attached to his nephew, and failed to see any good reason why a
      certain large farm near Martinhoe, quite a huge cantle from the Ley
      estates, which by a prior devise must fall to Albert upon his own demise,
      should be allowed to depart in that way from his posthumous control.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, like most of our fallible race, he went the worst possible way to
      work in pursuit of his favourite purpose. He threw the young people
      together daily, and dinned into the ears of each perpetual praise of the
      other. This seemed to answer well enough in the case of the simple Albert.
      He could never have too much of his lively cousin's company, neither could
      he weary of sounding her sweet excellence. But with the young maid it was
      not so. She liked the good Albert well enough, and never got out of his
      way at all. Moreover, sometimes his curly hair and bright moustache, when
      they came too near, would raise not a positive flutter, perhaps, but a
      sense of some fugitive movement in the unexplored distances of the heart.
      Still, this might go on for years, and nothing more to come of it. Frida
      loved her father best of all the world, at present.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There happened to be at this time an old fogy&mdash;of course it is most
      distressing to speak of anyone disrespectfully; but when one thinks of the
      trouble he caused, and not only that, but he was an old fogy, essentially
      and pre-eminently&mdash;and his name was Sir Maunder Meddleby. This worthy
      baronet, one of the first of a newly invented order, came in his sled
      stuffed with goose-feathers (because he was too fat to ride, and no wheels
      were yet known on the hill tracks) to talk about some exchange of land
      with his old friend, our De Wichehalse. The baron and the baronet had
      been making a happy day of it. Each knew pretty well exactly what his
      neighbour's little rashness might be hoped to lead to, and each in his
      mind was pretty sure of having the upper hand of it. Therefore both their
      hearts were open&mdash;business being now dismissed, and dinner over&mdash;to
      one another. They sat in a beautiful place, and drew refreshment of mind
      through their outward lips by means of long reeden tubes with bowls at
      their ends, and something burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clouds of delicate vapour wandered round and betwixt them and the sea; and
      each was well content to wonder whether the time need ever come when he
      must have to think again. Suddenly a light form flitted over the rocks, as
      the shadows flit; and though Frida ran away for fear of interrupting them,
      they knew who it was, and both, of course, began to think about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The baron gave a puff of his pipe, and left the baronet to begin. In
      course of time Sir Maunder spoke, with all that breadth and beauty of the
      vowels and the other things which a Devonshire man commands, from the lord
      lieutenant downward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If so be that 'ee gooth vor to ax me, ai can zay wan thing, and wan
      oney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What one thing is it, good neighbour? I am well content with her as she
      is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laikely enough. And 'e wad be zo till 'e zeed a zummut fainer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see nothing finer or better than what we have seen just now,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you be like all varthers, a'most! No zort o' oose to advaise 'un.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay! Far otherwise. I am not by any means of that nature. Sir
      Maunder Meddleby, I have the honour of craving your opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sir Maunder Meddleby thought for a while, or, at any rate, meant to be
      thinking, ere ever he dared to deliver himself of all his weighty
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've a-knowed she, my Lord Witcher, ever since her wore that haigh. A
      purty wanch, and a peart one. But her wanteth the vinish of the coort.
      Never do no good wi'out un, whan a coomth, as her must, to coorting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the very thing De Wichehalse was afraid to hear of. He had lived
      so mild a life among the folk who loved him that any fear of worry in
      great places was too much for him. And yet sometimes he could not help a
      little prick of thought about his duty to his daughter. Hence it came that
      common sense was driven wild by conscience, as forever happens with the
      few who keep that gadfly. Six great horses, who knew no conscience but had
      more fleshly tormentors, were ordered out, and the journey began, and at
      last it ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in London now was going almost anyhow. Kind and worthy people
      scarcely knew the way to look at things. They desired to respect the king
      and all his privilege, and yet they found his mind so wayward that they
      had no hold of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The court, however, was doing its best, from place to place in its
      wanderings, to despise the uproar and enjoy itself as it used to do.
      Bright and beautiful ladies gathered round the king, when the queen was
      gone, persuading him and one another that they must have their own way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the lords who helped these ladies to their strong opinions there was
      none in higher favour with the queen and the king himself than the young
      Lord Auberley. His dress was like a sweet enchantment, and his tongue was
      finer still, and his grace and beauty were as if no earth existed. Frida
      was a new thing to him, in her pure simplicity. He to her was such a
      marvel, such a mirror of the skies, as a maid can only dream of in the
      full moon of St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little dainty glance, and flushing, and the fear to look too much, and the
      stealthy joy of feeling that there must be something meant, yet the terror
      of believing anything in earnest and the hope that, after all, there may
      be nought to come of it; and when this hope seems over true, the hollow of
      the heart behind it, and the longing to be at home with anyone to love
      oneself&mdash;time is wasted in recounting this that always must be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enough that Frida loved this gallant from the depths of her pure heart,
      while he admired and loved her to the best of his ability.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The worthy baron was not of a versatile complexion. When his mind was
      quite made up he carried out the whole of it. But he could not now make up
      his mind upon either of two questions. Of these questions one was this&mdash;should
      he fight for the king or against him, in the struggle now begun? By
      hereditary instincts he was stanch for liberty, for letting people have
      their own opinions who could pay for them. And about religious matters and
      the royal view of them, he fell under sore misgiving that his grandfather
      on high would have a bone to pick with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His other difficulty was what to say, or what to think, about Lord
      Auberley. To his own plain way of judging, and that human instinct which,
      when highly cultivated, equals that of the weaker dogs, also to his
      recollection of what used to be expected in the time when he was young,
      Viscount Auberley did not give perfect satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, being governed as strong folk are by the gentle ones, the
      worthy baron winked at little things which did not please him, and went so
      far as to ask that noble spark to flash upon the natives of benighted
      Devon. Lord Auberley was glad enough to retire for a season, both for
      other reasons and because he saw that bitter fighting must be soon
      expected. Hence it happened that the six great Flemish horses were buckled
      to, early in September of the first year of the civil war, while the king
      was on his westward march collecting men and money. The queen was not
      expected back from the Continent for another month; there had scarcely
      been for all the summer even the semblance of a court fit to teach a
      maiden lofty carriage and cold dignity; so that Lord de Wichehalse thought
      Sir Maunder Meddleby an oaf for sending him to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was someone who had tasted strong delight and shuddering fear,
      glowing hope and chill despair, triumph, shame, and all confusion of the
      heart and mind and will, such as simple maidens hug into their blushing
      chastity by the moonlight of first love. Frida de Wichehalse knew for
      certain, and forever felt it settled, that in all the world of worlds
      never had been any body, any mind, or even soul, fit to think of twice
      when once you had beheld Lord Auberley.
    </p>
    <p>
      His young lordship, on the whole, was much of the same opinion. Low
      fellows must not have the honour to discharge their guns at him. He liked
      the king, and really meant no harm whatever to his peace of mind
      concerning his Henrietta; and, if the worst came to the worst, everyone
      knew that out of France there was no swordsman fit to meet, even with a
      rapier, the foil of Aubyn Auberley. Neither was it any slur upon his
      loyalty or courage that he was now going westward from the world of camps
      and war. It was important to secure the wavering De Wichehalse, the
      leading man of all the coast, from Mine-head down to Hartland; so that,
      with the full consent of all the king's advisers, Lord Auberley left court
      and camp to press his own suit peacefully. What a difference he found it
      to be here in mid-September, far away from any knowledge of the world and
      every care; only to behold the manner of the trees disrobing, blushing
      with a trembling wonder at the freedom of the winds, or in the wealth of
      deep wood browning into rich defiance; only to observe the colour of the
      hills, and cliffs, and glens, and the glory of the sea underneath the
      peace of heaven, when the balanced sun was striking level light all over
      them! And if this were not enough to make a man contented with his
      littleness and largeness, then to see the freshened Pleiads, after their
      long dip of night, over the eastern waters twinkling, glad to see us all
      once more and sparkling to be counted.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things, and a thousand others, which (without a waft of knowledge or
      of thought on our part) enter into and become our sweetest recollections,
      for the gay young lord possessed no charm, nor even interest. &ldquo;Dull, dull,
      how dull it is!&rdquo; was all he thought when he thought at all; and he vexed
      his host by asking how he could live in such a hole as that. And he would
      have vexed his young love, too, if young love were not so large of heart,
      by asking what the foreign tongue was which &ldquo;her people&rdquo; tried to speak.
      &ldquo;Their native tongue and mine, my lord!&rdquo; cried Frida, with the sweetness
      of her smile less true than usual, because she loved her people and the
      air of her nativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, take it altogether, this was a golden time for her. Golden trust
      and reliance are the well-spring of our nature, and that man is the
      happiest who is cheated every day almost. The pleasure is tenfold as great
      in being cheated as to cheat. Therefore Frida was as happy as the day and
      night are long. Though the trees were striped with autumn, and the green
      of the fields was waning, and the puce of the heath was faded into dingy
      cinnamon; though the tint of the rocks was darkened by the nightly rain and
      damp, and the clear brooks were beginning to be hoarse with shivering
      floods, and the only flowers left were but widows of the sun, yet she had
      the sovereign comfort and the cheer of trustful love. Lord Auberley,
      though he cared nought for the Valley of Rocks or Watersmeet, for beetling
      majesty of the cliffs or mantled curves of Woody Bay, and though he
      accounted the land a wilderness and the inhabitants savages, had taken a
      favourable view of the ample spread of the inland farms and the loyalty of
      the tenants, which naturally suggested the raising of the rental.
      Therefore he grew more attentive to young Mistress Frida; even sitting in
      shady places, which it made him damp to think of when he turned his eyes
      from her. Also he was moved a little by her growing beauty, for now the
      return to her native hills, the presence of her lover, and the home-made
      bread and forest mutton, combining with her dainty years, were making her
      look wonderful. If Aubyn Auberley had not been despoiled of all true
      manliness, by the petting and the froward wit of many a foreign lady, he
      might have won the pure salvation of an earnest love. But, when judged by
      that French standard which was now supreme at court, this poor Frida was a
      rustic, only fit to go to school. There was another fine young fellow who
      thought wholly otherwise. To him, in his simple power of judging for
      himself, and seldom budging from that judgment, there was no one fit to
      dream of in comparison with her. Often, in this state of mind, he longed
      to come forward and let them know what he thought concerning the whole of
      it. But Albert could not see his way toward doing any good with it, and
      being of a bashful mind, he kept his heart in order.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The stir of the general rising of the kingdom against the king had not
      disturbed these places yet beyond what might be borne with. Everybody
      liked to talk, and everybody else was ready to put in a word or two;
      broken heads, however, were as yet the only issue. So that when there came
      great news of a real battle fought, and lost by Englishmen against
      Englishmen, the indignation of all the country ran against both parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baron de Wichehalse had been thinking, after his crop of hay was in,&mdash;for
      such a faithful hay they have that it will not go from root to rick by
      less than two months of worrying,&mdash;from time to time, and even in the
      middle of his haycocks, this good lord had not been able to perceive his
      proper course. Arguments there were that sounded quite as if a baby must
      be perfectly convinced by them; and then there would be quite a different
      line of reason taken by someone who knew all about it and despised the
      opposite. So that many of a less decided way of thinking every day
      embraced whatever had been last confuted.
    </p>
    <p>
      This most manly view of matters and desire to give fair play was scorned,
      of course, by the fairer (and unfairer) half of men. Frida counted all as
      traitors who opposed their liege the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go forth, my lord; go forth and fight,&rdquo; she cried to Viscount Auberley,
      when the doubtful combat of Edgehill was firing new pugnacity; &ldquo;if I were
      a man, think you that I would let them do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, fair mistress! it will take a many men to help it. But since you
      bid me thus away&mdash;hi, Dixon! get my trunks packed!&rdquo; And then, of
      course, her blushing roses faded to a lily white; and then, of course, it
      was his duty to support her slender form; neither were those dulcet
      murmurs absent which forever must be present when the female kind begin to
      have the best of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they went on once or twice, and would have gone on fifty times if
      fortune had allowed them thus to hang on one another. All the world was
      fair around them; and themselves, as fair as any, vouched the whole world
      to attest their everlasting constancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one soft November evening, when the trees were full of drops, and
      gentle mists were creeping up the channels of the moorlands, and snipes
      (come home from foreign parts) were cheeping at their borings, and every
      weary man was gladdened by the glance of a bright wood fire, and smell of
      what was over it, there happened to come, on a jaded horse, a man, all
      hat, and cape, and boots, and mud, and sweat, and grumbling. All the
      people saw at once that it was quite impossible to make at all too much of
      him, because he must be full of news, which (after victuals) is the
      greatest need of human nature. So he had his own way as to everything he
      ordered; and, having ridden into much experience of women, kept himself as
      warm as could be, without any jealousy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stern man bore urgent order for the Viscount Auberley to join the
      king at once at Oxford, and bring with him all his gathering. Having
      gathered no men yet, but spent the time in plucking roses and the wild
      myrtles of Devonshire love, the young lord was for once a little taken
      aback at this order. Moreover, though he had been grumbling, half a dozen
      times a day&mdash;to make himself more precious&mdash;about the place, and
      the people, and the way they cooked his meals, he really meant it less and
      less as he came to know the neighbourhood. These are things which nobody
      can understand without seeing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I grieve, my lord,&rdquo; said the worthy baron, &ldquo;that you must leave us in
      this high haste.&rdquo; On the whole, however, this excellent man was partly
      glad to be quit of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am deeply indebted to your lordship for the grievance; but it must
      be so. <i>Que voulez-vous?</i> You talk the French, <i>mon baron?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With a Frenchman, my lord; but not when I have the honour to speak with
      an Englishman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there Foreign again! My lord, you will never speak English.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      De Wichehalse could never be quite sure, though his race had been long in
      this country, whether he or they could speak born English as it ought to
      be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you will find,&rdquo; he said at last, with grief as well as courtesy,
      &ldquo;many who speak one language Striving to silence one another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He fights best who fights the longest. You will come with us, my lord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a foot, not half an inch,&rdquo; the baron answered sturdily. &ldquo;I've
      a-laboured hard to zee my best, and 'a can't zee head nor tail to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus he spoke in imitation of what his leading tenant said, smiling
      brightly at himself, but sadly at his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even so!&rdquo; the young man answered; &ldquo;I will forth and pay my duty. The
      rusty-weathercock, my lord, is often too late for the oiling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this conceit he left De Wichehalse, and, while his grooms were making
      ready, sauntered down the zigzag path, which, through rocks and stubbed
      oaks, made toward the rugged headland known, far up and down the Channel,
      by the name of Duty Point. Near the end of this walk there lurked a soft
      and silent bower, made by Nature, and with all of Nature's art secluded.
      The ledge that wound along the rock-front widened, and the rock fell back
      and left a little cove, retiring into moss and ferny shade. Here the maid
      was well accustomed every day to sit and think, gazing down at the calm,
      gray sea, and filled with rich content and deep capacity of dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she was, at the present moment, resting in her pure love-dream,
      believing all the world as good, and true, and kind as her own young self.
      Round her all was calm and lovely; and the soft brown hand of autumn, with
      the sun's approval, tempered every mellow mood of leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aubyn Auberley was not of a sentimental cast of mind. He liked the poets
      of the day, whenever he deigned to read them; nor was he at all above
      accepting the dedication of a book. But it was not the fashion now&mdash;as
      had been in the noble time of Watson, Raleigh, and Shakspere&mdash;for men
      to look around and love the greater things they grow among.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frida was surprised to see her dainty lord so early. She came here in the
      morning always, when it did not rain too hard, to let her mind have
      pasture on the landscape of sweet memory. And even sweeter hope was always
      fluttering in the distance, on the sea, or clouds, or flitting vapour of
      the morning. Even so she now was looking at the mounting glory of the sun
      above the sea-clouds, the sun that lay along the land, and made the
      distance roll away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard and bitter is my task,&rdquo; the gallant lord began with her, &ldquo;to say
      farewell to all I love. But so it ever must be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frida looked at his riding-dress, and cold fear seized her suddenly, and
      then warm hope that he might only be riding after the bustards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My lord,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you never grant me that one little prayer of
      mine&mdash;to spare poor birds, and make those cruel gaze-hounds run down
      one another?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never see the gaze-hounds more,&rdquo; he answered petulantly; &ldquo;my time
      for sport is over. I must set forth for the war to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-day!&rdquo; she cried; and then tried to say a little more for pride's sake;
      &ldquo;to go to the war to-day, my lord!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas! it is too true. Either I must go, or be a traitor and a dastard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her soft blue eyes lay full on his, and tears that had not time to flow
      began to spread a hazy veil between her and the one she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw it, and he saw the rise and sinking of her wounded heart, and how
      the words she tried to utter fell away and died within her for the want of
      courage; and light and hard, and mainly selfish as his nature was, the
      strength, and depth, and truth of love came nigh to scare him for the
      moment even of his vanities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Frida!&rdquo; he said, with her hand in his, and bending one knee on the moss;
      &ldquo;only tell me that I must stay; then stay I will; the rest of the world
      may scorn if you approve me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This, of course, sounded very well and pleased her, as it was meant to do;
      still, it did not satisfy her&mdash;so exacting are young maidens, and so
      keen is the ear of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aubyn, you are good and true. How very good and true you are! But even by
      your dear voice now I know what you are thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Auberley, by this time, was as well within himself again as he
      generally found himself; so that he began to balance chances very
      knowingly. If the king should win the warfare and be paramount again, this
      bright star of the court must rise to something infinitely higher than a
      Devonshire squire's child. A fine young widow of a duke, of the royal
      blood of France itself, was not far from being quite determined to accept
      him, if she only could be certain how these things would end themselves.
      Many other ladies were determined quite as bravely to wait the course of
      events, and let him have them, if convenient. On the other hand, if the
      kingdom should succeed in keeping the king in order&mdash;which was the
      utmost then intended&mdash;Aubyn Auberley might be only too glad to fall
      back upon Frida.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking it wiser, upon the whole, to make sure of this little lamb, with
      nobler game in prospect, Lord Auberley heaved as deep a sigh as the size
      of his chest could compass. After which he spoke as follows, in a most
      delicious tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sweetest, and my only hope, the one star of my wanderings; although you
      send me forth to battle, where my arm is needed, give me one dear pledge
      that ever you will live and die my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was just what Frida wanted, having trust (as our free-traders, by
      vast amplitude of vision, have in reciprocity) that if a man gets the best
      of a woman he is sure to give it back. Therefore these two sealed and
      delivered certain treaties (all unwritten, but forever engraven upon the
      best and tenderest feelings of the lofty human nature) that nothing less
      than death, or even greater, should divide them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there one, among the many who survive such process, unable to imagine
      or remember how they parted? The fierce and even desperate anguish, nursed
      and made the most of; the pride and self-control that keep such things for
      comfort afterward; the falling of the heart that feels itself the true
      thing after all. Let it be so, since it must be; and no sympathy can heal
      it, since in every case it never, never, was so bad before!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Lovers come, and lovers go; ecstasies of joy and anguish have their proper
      intervals; and good young folk, who know no better, revel in high misery.
      But the sun ascends the heavens at the same hour of the day, by himself
      dictated; and if we see him not, it is our earth that spreads the curtain.
      Nevertheless, these lovers, being out of rule with everything, heap their
      own faults on his head, and want him to be setting always, that they may
      behold the moon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore it was useless for the wisest man in the north of Devon, or even
      the wisest woman, to reason with young Frida now, or even to let her have
      the reason upon her side, and be sure of it. She, for her part, was astray
      from all the bounds of reason, soaring on the wings of faith, and hope,
      and high delusion. Though the winter-time was coming, and the wind was
      damp and raw, and the beauty of the valleys lay down to recover itself;
      yet with her the spring was breaking, and the world was lifting with the
      glory underneath it. Because it had been firmly pledged&mdash;and who
      could ever doubt it?&mdash;that the best and noblest lover in this world
      of noble love would come and grandly claim and win his bride on her next
      birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Christmas she had further pledge of her noble lover's constancy. In
      spite of difficulties, dangers, and the pressing need of men, he contrived
      to send her by some very valiant messengers (none of whom would ride
      alone) a beautiful portrait of himself, set round with sparkling diamonds;
      also a necklace of large pearls, as white and pure as the neck whose grace
      was to enhance their beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hereupon such pride and pleasure mounted into her cheeks and eyes, and
      flushed her with young gaiety, that all who loved her, being grafted with
      good superstition, nearly spoiled their Christmas-time by serious
      sagacity. She, however, in the wealth of all she had to think of, heeded
      none who trod the line of prudence and cold certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than I can tell,&rdquo; she used to say, most prettily, to anybody
      who made bold to ask her about anything; &ldquo;all things go so in and out that
      I am sure of nothing else except that I am happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The baron now began to take a narrow, perhaps a natural, view of all the
      things around him. In all the world there was for him no sign or semblance
      of any being whose desires or strictest rights could be thought of more
      than once when set against his daughter's. This, of course, was very bad
      for Frida's own improvement. It could not make her selfish yet, but it
      really made her wayward. The very best girls ever seen are sure to have
      their failings; and Frida, though one of the very best, was not above all
      nature. People made too much of this, when she could no more defend
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever may have been to blame, one thing at least is certain&mdash;the
      father, though he could not follow all his child's precipitance, yet was
      well contented now to stoop his gray head to bright lips, and do his best
      toward believing some of their soft eloquence. The child, on the other
      hand, was full of pride, and rose on tiptoe, lest anybody might suppose
      her still too young for anything. Thus between them they looked forward to
      a pleasant time to come, hoping for the best, and judging everyone with
      charity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing that vexed them most (for always there must, of course, be
      something) was the behaviour of Albert, nephew to the baron, and most
      loving cousin of Frida. Nothing they could do might bring him to spend his
      Christmas with them; and this would be the first time ever since his
      long-clothed babyhood that he had failed to be among them, and to lead or
      follow, just as might be required of him. Such a guest has no small value
      in a lonely neighbourhood, and years of usage mar the circle of the year
      without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas passed, and New Year's Day, and so did many other days. The
      baron saw to his proper work, and took his turn of hunting, and
      entertained his neighbours, and pleased almost everybody. Much against his
      will, he had consented to the marriage of his daughter with Lord Auber-ley&mdash;to
      make the best of a bad job, as he told Sir Maunder Meddleby. Still, this
      kind and crafty father had his own ideas; for the moment he was swimming
      with the tide to please his daughter, even as for her dear sake he was
      ready to sink beneath it. Yet, these fathers have a right to form their
      own opinions; and for the most part they believe that they have more
      experience. Frida laughed at this, of course, and her father was glad to
      see her laugh. Nevertheless, he could not escape some respect for his own
      opinion, having so rarely found it wrong; and his own opinion was that
      something was very likely to happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this he proved to be quite right. For many things began to happen, some
      on the-right and some on the left hand of the-baron's auguries. All of
      them, however, might be reconciled exactly with the very thing he had
      predicted. He noticed this, and it pleased him well, and inspired him so
      that he started anew for even truer prophecies. And everybody round the
      place was-born so to respect him that, if he missed the mark a little,
      they could hit it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Things stood thus at the old Ley Manor&mdash;and folk were content to have
      them so, for fear of getting worse, perhaps&mdash;toward the end of
      January, a. d. 1643. De Wichehalse had vowed that his only child&mdash;although
      so clever for her age, and prompt of mind and body&mdash;should not enter
      into marriage until she was in her eighteenth year. Otherwise, it would,
      no doubt, have all been settled long ago; for Aubyn Auberley sometimes had
      been in the greatest hurry. However, hither he must come now, as everybody
      argued, even though the fate of England hung on his stirrup-leather.
      Because he had even sent again, with his very best intentions, fashionable
      things for Frida, and the hottest messages; so that, if they did not mean
      him to be quite beside himself, everything must be smoking for his wedding
      at the Candlemas.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when everything and even everybody else&mdash;save Albert and the
      baron, and a few other obstinate people&mdash;was and were quite ready and
      rejoicing for a grand affair, to be celebrated with well-springs of wine
      and delightfully cordial Watersmeet, rocks of beef hewn into valleys, and
      conglomerate cliffs of pudding; when ruddy dame and rosy damsel were
      absorbed in &ldquo;what to wear,&rdquo; and even steady farmers were in &ldquo;practice for
      the back step&rdquo;; in a word, when all the country was gone wild about
      Frida's wedding&mdash;one night there happened to come a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man tied his horse to a gate and sneaked into the back yard, and
      listened in a quiet corner, knowing, as he did, the ins and outs and ways
      of the kitchen. Because he was that very same man who understood the women
      so, and made himself at home, by long experience, in new places. It had
      befallen this man, as it always befell any man of perception, to be
      smitten with the kindly loveliness of Frida. Therefore, now, although he
      was as hungry as ever he had been, his heart was such that he heard the
      sound of dishes, yet drew no nearer. Experience of human nature does not
      always spoil it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the baron at last received the letter which this rider had been so
      abashed to deliver, slow but lasting wrath began to gather in his
      gray-lashed eyes. It was the inborn anger of an honest man at villany
      mixed with lofty scorn and traversed by a dear anxiety. Withal he found
      himself so helpless that he scarce knew what to do. He had been to Frida
      both a father and a mother, as she often used to tell him when she wanted
      something; but now he felt that no man could administer the velvet touches
      of the female sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, although he was so kind, and had tried to think what his
      daughter thought, he found himself in a most ungenial mood for sweet
      condolement. Any but the best of fathers would have been delighted with
      the proof of all his prophecies and the riddance of a rogue. So that even
      he, though dwelling in his child's heart as his own, read this letter
      (when the first emotions had exploded) with a real hope that things, in
      the long run, would come round again.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;To my most esteemed and honoured friend, the Lord de
     Wichehalse, these from his most observant and most grateful
     Aubya Auberley,&mdash;Under command of his Majesty, our most
     Royal Lord and King, I have this day been joined in bands of
     holy marriage with her Highness, the Duchess of B&mdash;&mdash;, in
     France. At one time I had hope of favour with your good
     Lordship's daughter, neither could I have desired more
     complete promotion. But the service of the kingdom and the
     doubt of my own desert have forced me, in these troublous
     times, to forego mine own ambition. Our lord the King
     enjoins you with his Royal commendation, to bring your
     forces toward Bristowe by the day of St. Valentine. There
     shall I be in hope to meet your Lordship, and again find
     pleasure  in such goodly company.      Until then  I  am
     your Lordship's poor and humble servant,

     &ldquo;AUBYN AUBERLEY.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Lord de Wichehalse made his mind up not to let his daughter know until the
      following morning what a heavy blow had fallen on her faith and fealty.
      But, as evil chance would have it, the damsels of the house&mdash;and most
      of all the gentle cook-maid&mdash;could not but observe the rider's state
      of mind toward them. He managed to eat his supper in a dark state of
      parenthesis; but after that they plied him with some sentimental mixtures,
      and, being only a man at best, although a very trusty one, he could not
      help the rise of manly wrath at every tumbler. So, in spite of dry
      experience and careworn discretion, at last he let the woman know the
      whole of what himself knew. Nine good females crowded round him, and, of
      course, in their kind bosoms every word of all his story germinated
      ninety-fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hence it came to pass that, after floods of tears in council and stronger
      language than had right to come from under aprons, Frida's nurse (the old
      herb-woman, now called &ldquo;Mother Eyebright&rdquo;) was appointed to let her know
      that very night the whole of it. Because my lord might go on mooning for a
      month about it, betwixt his love of his daughter and his quiet way of
      taking things; and all that while the dresses might be cut, and trimmed,
      and fitted to a size and fashion all gone by before there came a wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mother Eyebright so was called both from the brightness of her eyes and
      her faith in that little simple flower, the euphrasia. Though her own
      love-tide was over, and the romance of life had long relapsed into the old
      allegiance to the hour of dinner, yet her heart was not grown tough to the
      troubles of the young ones; therefore all that she could do was done, but
      it was little.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frida, being almost tired with the blissful cares of dress, happened to go
      up that evening earlier than her wont to bed. She sat by herself in the
      firelight, with many gorgeous things around her&mdash;wedding presents
      from great people, and (what touched her more) the humble offerings of her
      cottage friends. As she looked on these and thought of all the good will
      they expressed, and how a little kindness gathers such a heap of
      gratitude, glad tears shone in her bright eyes, and she only wished that
      all the world could be as blessed as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her entered Mother Eyebright, now unworthy of her name; and sobbing,
      writhing, crushing anguish is a thing which even Frida, simple and
      open-hearted one, would rather keep to her own poor self.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the following day she was not half so wretched and lamentable as was
      expected of her. She even showed a brisk and pleasant air to the chief
      seamstress, and bade her keep some pretty things for the time of her own
      wedding. Even to her father she behaved as if there had been nothing more
      than happens every day. The worthy baron went to fold her in his arms, and
      let her cry there; but she only gave him a kiss, and asked the maid for
      some salt butter. Lord de Wichehalse, being disappointed of his outlet,
      thought (as all his life he had been forced to think continually) that any
      sort of woman, whether young or old, is wonderful. And so she carried on,
      and no one well could understand her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She, however, in her own heart, knew the ups and downs of it. She alone
      could feel the want of any faith remaining, the ache of ever stretching
      forth and laying hold on nothing. Her mind had never been encouraged&mdash;as
      with maidens nowadays&mdash;to-magnify itself, and soar, and scorn the
      heart that victuals it. All the deeper was her trouble, being less to be
      explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a day or two the story is that she contrived to keep her distance, and
      her own opinion of what had been done to her. Child and almost baby as her
      father had considered her, even he was awed from asking what she meant to
      do about it. Something seemed to keep her back from speaking of her
      trouble, or bearing to have it spoken of. Only to her faithful hound, with
      whom she now began again to wander in the oak-wood, to him alone had she
      the comfort of declaring anything. This was a dog of fine old English
      breed and high connections, his great-grandmother having owned a kennel at
      Whitehall itself&mdash;a very large and well-conducted dog, and now an old
      one, going down into his grave without a stain upon him. Only he had shown
      such foul contempt of Aubyn Auberley, proceeding to extremes of
      ill-behaviour toward his raiment, that for months young Frida had been
      forced to keep him chained, and take her favourite walks without him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, Lear!&rdquo; now she cried, with sense of long injustice toward him; &ldquo;you
      were right, and I was wrong; at least&mdash;at least it seems so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lear,&rdquo; so called whether by some man who had heard of Shakspere, or (as
      seems more likely) from his peculiar way of contemplating the world at his
      own angle, shook his ears when thus addressed, and looked too wise for any
      dog to even sniff his wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frida now allowed this dog to lead the way, and she would follow, careless
      of whatever mischief might be in the road for them. So he led her, without
      care or even thought on her part, to a hut upon the beach of Woody Bay;
      where Albert had set up his staff, to think of her and watch her. This,
      her cousin and true lover, had been grieving for her sorrow to the utmost
      power of a man who wanted her himself. It may have been beyond his power
      to help saying to himself sometimes, &ldquo;How this serves her right, for
      making such a laughing-stock of me!&rdquo; Nevertheless, he did his utmost to be
      truly sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, as he came forth to meet her, in his fishing dress and boots (as
      different a figure as could be from Aubyn Auberley), memories of childish
      troubles and of strong protection thrilled her with a helpless hope of
      something to be done for her. So she looked at him, and let him see the
      state her eyes were in with constant crying, when there was not anyone to
      notice it. Also, she allowed him to be certain what her hands were like,
      and to be surprised how much she had fallen away in her figure. Neither
      was she quite as proud as might have been expected, to keep her voice from
      trembling or her plundered heart from sobbing. Only, let not anybody say a
      word to comfort her. Anything but that she now could bear, as she bore
      everything. It was, of course, the proper thing for everyone to scorn her.
      That, of course, she had fully earned, and met it, therefore, with
      disdain. Only, she could almost hate anybody who tried to comfort her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert de Wichehalse, with a sudden start of intuition, saw what her
      father had been unable to descry or even dream. The worthy baron's time of
      life for fervid thoughts was over; for him despairing love was but a
      poet's fiction, or a joke against a pale young lady. But Albert felt from
      his own case, from burning jealousy suppressed, and cold neglect put up
      with, and all the other many-pointed aches of vain devotion, how sad must
      be the state of things when plighted faith was shattered also, and great
      ridicule left behind, with only a young girl to face it, motherless, and
      having none to stroke dishevelled hair, and coax the troubles by the
      firelight. However, this good fellow did the utmost he could do for her.
      Love and pity led him into dainty loving kindness; and when he could not
      find his way to say the right thing, he did better&mdash;he left her to
      say it. And so well did he move her courage, in his old protective way,
      without a word that could offend her or depreciate her love, that she for
      the moment, like a woman, wondered at her own despair. Also, like a woman,
      glancing into this and that, instead of any steadfast gazing, she had
      wholesome change of view, winning sudden insight into Albert's thoughts
      concerning her. Of course, she made up her mind at once, although her
      heart was aching so for want of any tenant, in a moment to extinguish any
      such presumption. Still, she would have liked to have it made a little
      clearer, if it were for nothing else than to be sure of something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Albert saw her safely climb the steep and shaly walk that led, among
      retentive oak trees, or around the naked gully, all the way from his
      lonely cottage to the light, and warmth, and comfort of the peopled Manor
      House. And within himself he thought, the more from contrast of his own
      cold comfort and untended state:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! she will forget it soon; she is so young. She will soon get over that
      gay frippard's fickleness. To-morrow I will start upon my little errand
      cheerfully. After that she will come round; they cannot feel as we do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Full of these fond hopes, he started on the following morning with set
      purpose to compel the man whom he had once disliked, and now despised
      unspeakably, to render some account of despite done to such a family. For,
      after all, the dainty viscount was the grandson of a goldsmith, who by
      brokerage for the Crown had earned the balls of his coronet. In quest of
      this gay fellow went the stern and solid Albert, leaving not a word about
      his purpose there behind him, but allowing everybody to believe what all
      found out. All found out, as he expected, that he was gone to sell his
      hay, perhaps as far as Taunton; and all the parish, looking forward to
      great rise of forage, felt indignant that he had not doubled his price,
      and let them think.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alack-a-day and all the year round! that men perceive not how the women
      differ from them in the very source of thought Albert never dreamed that
      his cousin, after doing so long without him, had now relapsed quite
      suddenly into her childish dependence upon him. And when she heard, on the
      following day, that he was gone for the lofty purpose of selling his seven
      ricks of hay, she said not a word, but only felt her cold heart so much
      colder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      She had nothing now to do, and nobody to speak to; though her father did
      his utmost, in his kind and clumsy way, to draw his darling close to him.
      But she knew that all along he had disliked her idol, and she fancied, now
      and then, that this dislike had had something perhaps to do with what had
      befallen her. This, of course, was wrong on her part. But when youth and
      faith are wronged, the hurt is very apt to fly to all the tender places.
      Even the weather also seemed to have taken a turn against her. No
      wholesome frost set in to brace the slackened joints and make her walk
      until she began to tingle; neither was there any snow to spread a new cast
      on the rocks and gift the trees with airiness; nor even what mild winters,
      for the most part, bring in counterpoise&mdash;soft, obedient skies, and
      trembling pleasure of the air and earth. But&mdash;as over her own love&mdash;over
      all the country hung just enough of mist and chill to shut out cheerful
      prospect, and not enough to shut folk in to the hearth of their own
      comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her dull, forlorn condition, Frida still, through force of habit or the
      love of solitude, made her daily round of wood and rock, seashore and
      moorland. Things seemed to come across her now, instead of her going to
      them, and her spirit failed at every rise of the hilly road against her.
      In that dreary way she lingered, hoping nothing, fearing nothing, showing
      neither sigh nor tear, only seeking to go somewhere and be lost from self
      and sorrow in the cloudy and dark day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Often thus the soft, low moaning of the sea encompassed her, where she
      stood, in forgotten beauty, careless of the wind and wave. The short,
      uneasy heave of waters in among the kelpy rocks, flowing from no swell or
      furrow on the misty glass of sea, but like a pulse of discontent, and
      longing to go further; after the turn, the little rattle of invaded
      pebbles, the lithe relapse and soft, shampooing lambency of oarweed, then
      the lavered boulders pouring gritty runnels back again, and every basined
      outlet wavering toward another inlet; these, and every phase of each
      innumerable to-and-fro, made or met their impress in her fluctuating
      misery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the only rest,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the only chance of being quiet, after
      all that I have done, and all that people say of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      None had been dastard enough to say a syllable against her; neither had
      she, in the warmest faith of love, forgotten truth; but her own dejection
      drove her, not to revile the world (as sour natures do consistently), but
      to shrink from sight, and fancy that the world was reviling her.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she fluttered thus and hovered over the cold verge of death, with
      her sore distempered spirit, scarcely sure of anything, tidings came of
      another trouble, and turned the scale against her. Albert de Wichehalse,
      her trusty cousin and true lover, had fallen in a duel with that recreant
      and miscreant Lord Auberley. The strictest orders were given that this
      should be kept for the present from Frida's ears; but what is the use of
      the strictest orders when a widowed mother raves? Albert's mother vowed
      that &ldquo;the shameless jilt&rdquo; should hear it out, and slipped her guards and
      waylaid Frida on the morn of Candlemas, and overbore her with such words
      as may be well imagined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Auntie!&rdquo; said the poor thing at last, shaking her beautiful curls, and
      laying one little hand to her empty heart, &ldquo;don't be cross with me to-day.
      I am going home to be married, auntie. It is the day my Aubyn always
      fixed, and he never fails me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little fool!&rdquo; her aunt exclaimed, as Frida kissed her hand and
      courtesied, and ran round the corner; &ldquo;one comfort is to know that she is
      as mad as a mole, at any rate.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Frida, knowing&mdash;perhaps more deeply than that violent woman thought&mdash;the
      mischief thus put into her, stole back to her bedroom, and, without a word
      to anyone, tired her hair in the Grecian snood which her lover used to
      admire so, and arrayed her soft and delicate form in all the bridal
      finery. Perhaps, that day, no bride in England&mdash;certainly none of her
      youth and beauty&mdash;treated her favourite looking-glass with such
      contempt and ingratitude. She did not care to examine herself, through
      some reluctant sense of havoc, and a bitter fear that someone might be
      disappointed in her. Then at the last, when all was ready, she snatched up
      her lover's portrait (which for days had been cast aside and cold), and,
      laying it on her bosom, took a snatch of a glance at her lovely self.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some wonder she fetched a deep sigh&mdash;not from clearly thinking
      anything, but as an act of nature&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Good-by!&rdquo; forever, with
      a little smile of irony, to her looking-glass, and all the many pretty
      things that knew her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was her bad luck, as some people thought thereafter&mdash;or her good
      luck, as herself beheld it&mdash;to get down the stairs and out of the
      house without anyone being the wiser. For the widow De Wichehalse,
      Albert's mother, had not been content with sealing the doom of this poor
      maiden, but in that highly excited state, which was to be expected,
      hurried into the house, to beard the worthy baron in his den. There she
      found him; and, although he said and did all sympathy, the strain of
      parental feelings could not yield without &ldquo;hysterics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All the servants, and especially Mother Eyebright (whose chief duty now
      was to watch Frida), were called by the terrified baron, and with one
      unanimous rush replied; so that the daughter of the house left it without
      notice, and before any glances was out of sight, in the rough ground where
      the deer were feeding, and the umber oak-leaves hung.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the dainty time when first the year begins to have a little hope of
      meaning kindly&mdash;when in the quiet places often, free from any haste
      of wind, or hindrances of pattering thaw, small and unimportant flowers
      have a little knack of dreaming that the world expects them. Therefore
      neither do they wait for leaves to introduce them, nor much weather to
      encourage, but in shelfy corners come, in a day, or in a night&mdash;no
      man knows quite which it is; and there they are, as if by magic, asking,
      &ldquo;Am I welcome?&rdquo; And if anybody sees them, he is sure to answer &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Frida, in the sheltered corners and the sunny nooks of rock, saw a few of
      these little things delicately trespassing upon the petulance of spring.
      Also, though her troubles wrapped her with an icy mantle, softer breath of
      Nature came, and sighed for her to listen to it, and to make the best of
      all that is not past the sighing. More than once she stopped to listen, in
      the hush of the timid south wind creeping through the dishevelled wood;
      and once, but only once, she was glad to see her first primrose and last,
      and stooped to pluck, but, on second thoughts, left it to outblossom her.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, past many a briered rock, and dingle buff with littered fern, green
      holly copse where lurked the woodcock, and arcades of zigzag oak, Frida
      kept her bridal robe from spot, or rent, or blemish. Passing all these
      little pleadings of the life she had always loved, at last she turned the
      craggy corner into the ledge of the windy cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now below her there was nothing but repose from shallow thought; rest from
      all the little troubles she had made so much of; deep, eternal
      satisfaction in the arms of something vast. But all the same, she did not
      feel quite ready for the great jump yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tide was in, and she must wait at least until it began to turn,
      otherwise her white satin velvet would have all its pile set wrong, if
      ever anybody found her. There could be no worse luck than that for any
      bride on her wedding-day; therefore up the rock-walk Frida kept very close
      to the landward side.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this way she thought of pretty little things said to her in the early
      days of love. Many things that made her smile because they had gone so
      otherwise, and one or two that would have fetched her tears, if she had
      any. Filled with vain remembrance thus, and counting up the many presents
      sent to her for this occasion, but remaining safe at home, Frida came to
      the little coving bower just inside the Point, where she could go no
      further. Here she had received the pledges, and the plight, and honour;
      and here her light head led her on to look for something faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the tide turns I shall know it. If he does not come by that time,
      there will be no more to do. It will be too late for weddings, for the
      tide turns at twelve o'clock. How calm and peaceful is the sea! How happy
      are the sea gulls, and how true to one another!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood where, if she had cared for life, it would have been certain
      death to stand, so giddy was the height, and the rock beneath her feet so
      slippery. The craggy headland, Duty Point, well known to every navigator
      of that rock-bound coast, commands the Channel for many a league, facing
      eastward the Castle Rock and Countisbury Foreland, and westward High-veer
      Point, across the secluded cove of Leymouth. With one sheer fall of a
      hundred fathoms the stern cliff meets the baffled sea&mdash;or met it
      then, but now the level of the tide is lowering. Air and sea were still
      and quiet; the murmur of the multitudinous wavelets could not climb the
      cliff; but loops and curves of snowy braiding on the dark gray water
      showed the set of tide and shift of current in and out the buried rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing in the void of fear, and gazing into the deep of death, Frida
      loved the pair of sea gulls hovering halfway between her and the soft gray
      sea. These good birds had found a place well suited for their nesting, and
      sweetly screamed to one another that it was a contract. Frida watched how
      proud they were, and how they kept their strong wings sailing and their
      gray backs flat and quivering, while with buoyant bosom each made circles
      round the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she watched, she saw the turning of the tide below them. The streaky
      bends of curdled water, lately true as fairy-rings, stopped and wavered,
      and drew inward on their flowing curves, and outward on the side toward
      the ebb. Then the south wind brought the distant toll of her father's
      turret-clock, striking noon with slow deliberation and dead certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frida made one little turn toward her bower behind the cliff, where the
      many sweet words spoken drew her to this last of hope. All was silent.
      There was no one Now was the time to go home at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she felt a heavy drag upon her velvet skirt. Ancient Lear had
      escaped from the chain she had put on him, and, more trusty than mankind,
      was come to keep his faith with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fine old dog, it is too late! The clock has struck. The tide has
      turned. There is no one left to care for me; and I have ruined everyone.
      Good-by, you only true one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Submissive as he always was, the ancient dog lay down when touched, and
      drew his grizzled eyelids meekly over his dim and sunken eyes. Before he
      lifted them again Frida was below the sea gulls, and beneath the waves
      they fished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lear, with a puzzled sniff, arose and shook his head, and peered, with his
      old eyes full of wistful wonder, down the fearful precipice. Seeing
      something, he made his mind, up, gave one long re-echoed howl, then tossed
      his mane, like a tawny wave, and followed down the death-leap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither body was ever found; and the whole of this might not have been
      known so clearly as it is known, unless it had happened that Mother
      Eyebright, growing uneasy, came round the corner just in time to be too
      late. She, like a sensible woman, never dreamed of jumping after them, but
      ran home so fast that she could not walk to church for three months
      afterward; and when her breath came back was enabled to tell tenfold of
      all she had seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the strangest things in life is the way in which we mortals take
      the great and fatal blows of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, the baron was suddenly told, while waiting for Frida to sit
      beside him, at his one o'clock dinner:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Plaize, my lard, your lardship's darter hath a been and jumped off Duty
      Point.&rdquo;
     </p>

      Aubyn Auberley, however, took a different measure of a broken-hearted
      father's strength. For the baron buckled on the armour of a century ago,
      which had served his grandsire through hard blows in foreign battles, and,
      with a few of his trusty servants, rode to join the Parliament. It
      happened so that he could not make redress of his ruined life until the
      middle of the summer. Then, at last, his chance came to him, and he did

      Lansdowne.

      play with this old man as he had with his daughter; but the Gueldres ax
      cleft his curly head, and split what little brain it takes to fool a
      trusting maiden.

      So, in early life, deceiver and deceived were quit of harm; and may ere
      now have both found out whether it is better to inflict the wrong or
      suffer it.
